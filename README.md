Alien Game

In this alien game, which uses Pygame, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using arrow keys. The player shoots bullets from the ship using the spacebar. To begin the game, the player can click on the play button or press p on the keyboard. The player can quit the game at any time by pressing q on the keyboard. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fill the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, the player moves up a level, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet, and the ship can also travel faster. Each new level is more difficult than the previous level. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. The player is given only three ships and if the player loses all three ships, the game ends. 

To play the game, run the "alien_invasion.py" file.
